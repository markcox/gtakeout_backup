# gtakeout_backup
Scripts to assist downloading Google Takeout archives in parallel and to automate deduplication and backup of Google Takeout archives.

You can watch a demo showing how to copy the Takeout archive URL out of Google Chrome's developer tools, and use of the `get_takeout.sh` script, from [my YouTube video](https://youtu.be/h5idAEJorIc).
